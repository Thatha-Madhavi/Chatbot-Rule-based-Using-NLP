## 📘 Overview

This project demonstrates a rule-based approach to building chatbots.
Instead of using machine learning models, the chatbot:

- Uses regular expressions (regex)

- Matches patterns in user messages

- Returns predefined responses

- Falls back to a default message when input is not understood

This makes the chatbot simple, predictable, and easy to extend.

## ✨ Features

✔ Regex-based pattern matching
✔ Multiple responses for variety
✔ Clean fallback/default response
✔ No training data required
✔ Beginner-friendly
✔ Lightweight—runs instantly
✔ Fully customizable patterns/responses
